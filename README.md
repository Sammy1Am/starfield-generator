# starfield-generator
 Javascript / HTML page for generating star fields for fiber optic ceilings

Based on the generator found [here](https://www.starceiling.co.uk/large.html), and updated as part of [this project](https://medium.com/@samdium/fiber-optic-star-ceiling-d5801cdcec00).  To use, just download this repository and open the `.html` file.

To adjust where obstacles (e.g. joists, ceiling lights, etc.) render, you'll need to manually adjust [these lines](https://github.com/Sammy1Am/starfield-generator/blob/06437aed895dcac902833bde37d55c71c512f1a4/large.html#L325-L341).

I don't currently have any plans to improve this code (my project is done, see link above), but welcome PRs for additional features.  Thanks to [Seb Francis](http://burnit.co.uk/) for making the original.
